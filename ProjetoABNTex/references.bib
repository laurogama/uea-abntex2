@article{Katsivelis2010,
abstract = {The Electrostatic Discharge phenomenon is a great threat to all electronic devices and ICs. An electric charge passing rapidly from a charged body to another can seriously harm the last one. However, there is a lack in a linear mathematical approach which will make it possible to design a circuit capable of producing such a sophisticated current waveform. The commonly accepted Electrostatic Discharge current waveform is the one set by the IEC 61000-4-2. However, the over-simplified circuit included in the same standard is incapable of producing such a waveform. Treating the Electrostatic Discharge current waveform of the IEC 61000-4-2 as reference, an approximation method, based on Prony?s method, is developed and applied in order to obtain a linear system?s response. Considering a known input, a method to design a circuit, able to generate this ESD current waveform in presented. The circuit synthesis assumes ideal active elements. A simulation is carried out using the PSpice software.},

@phdthesis{Hwang2005,
abstract = {Electrostatic discharge (ESD) causes a significant percentage of the failures in the electronics industry. The shrinking size of semiconductor circuits, thinner gate oxides, complex chips with multiple power supplies and mixed-signal blocks, larger chip capacitance and faster circuit operation, all contribute to increased ESD sensitivity of advanced semiconductor devices. Therefore, understanding and controlling ESD is indispensable for higher quality and reliability of advanced device technologies. This thesis provides a comprehensive understanding of ESD and EOS failures in GaAs and SiGe devices. In the first part of this thesis, characteristics of internal damage caused by several ESD test models and EOS stress in non-silicon devices (GaAs and SiGe) are identified. Failure signatures are correlated with field failures using various failure analysis techniques. The second part of this thesis discusses the effects of ESD latent damage in GaAs devices. Depending on the stress level, ESD voltage can causes latent failures if the device is repeatedly stressed under low ESD voltage conditions, and can cause premature damage leading eventually to catastrophic failures. Electrical degradation due to ESD- induced latent damage in GaAs MESFETs after cumulative low-level ESD stress is studied. Using failure analysis, combined with electrical characterization, the failure modes and signatures of EOS stressed devices with and without prior low-level ESD stress are compared. To predict the power-to-failure level of GaAs and silicon devices, an ESD failure model using a thermal RC network was developed. A correlation method of the real ESD stress and square wave pulse has been developed. The equivalent duration of the square pulse is calculated and proposed for the HBM ESD stress. The dependence of this value on the ESD stress level and material properties is presented as well.},

@article{Berndt2010,
abstract = {The number of failures caused by electrostatic discharges (ESD) has been increasing for some time now. So, it is necessary for everyone, who handles electrostatic sensitive devices (ESDS), to know the reasons of such failures. This presentation will give an overview about possible causes for ESD in a SMT production line. Particularly automated production lines have some processing steps, where electrostatic charges are increasingly generated. So far one has been focused on the human being. This is controllable. Measurements in production lines show electrostatic charges at the following processing steps: application of soldering paste (printer), assembling (automated and manual pick and place), and labelling as well as optical and electrical tests (ICT). The electronic components are always assembled directly and without any covering on the PCBs. Thus, the wire bonding process leads to a damage of the electronic components. This process step is a very critical part in the production line. The electronic devices will be directly contacted with a metal needle. The process steps, where the PCBs are covered with enclosures must be inspected either. Such enclosures are mostly made of isolating materials, like plastics. Thus, those can be electrostatic charged highly, while assembling. An optimized ESD Control System for machines with the emphasis on cost-effectiveness will be presented.},
